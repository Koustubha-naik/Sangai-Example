&lt;p&gt;Keibul Lamjao National Park is the &lt;strong&gt;world’s only floating national park&lt;/strong&gt;, located on the southern edge of Loktak Lake in Manipur.&lt;br&gt;
Its landscape, wildlife, and ecosystem are unlike anywhere else in the world.&lt;br&gt;
Here are the &lt;strong&gt;most important features&lt;/strong&gt; that define this extraordinary place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="-1-the-sangai-deer--the-heart-of-the-park"&gt;🥇 1. The Sangai Deer — The Heart of the Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sangai&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Rucervus eldii eldii&lt;/em&gt;) is the most important species in the park and the primary reason this area is protected.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Life of the Local Fishermen</title><link>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/phumdis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/phumdis/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-lives-of-the-local-fishermen"&gt;🛶 Lives of the Local Fishermen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loktak Lake is more than a body of water — it is a living, breathing lifeline for the communities that surround it.&lt;br&gt;
For generations, families have depended on this vast lake for food, income, shelter, and identity. The relationship between the people and the lake is deep and ancient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="-a-life-connected-to-the-water"&gt;🌾 A Life Connected to the Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fishermen of Loktak begin their day before sunrise.&lt;br&gt;
As the first light touches the water, they set out in long, narrow boats called &lt;strong&gt;higee thangou&lt;/strong&gt;, gliding silently across the lake. The soft mist covers everything, making their silhouettes blend into the morning calm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Morning Mist of Loktak</title><link>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/morning-mist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/morning-mist/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-morning-mist-of-loktak"&gt;🌅 Morning Mist of Loktak&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning, just before the sun rises over Loktak Lake, the world becomes quiet and weightless.
A thin sheet of mist drifts across the water, softening every sound and turning the entire lake into a pale, glowing dream.
The fishermen move slowly through this silent world, their boats cutting smooth lines through the silver haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moment — delicate, cold, and peaceful — is one of the most breathtaking scenes in the Sangai’s floating home.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Birds of Loktak Lake</title><link>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/birds-of-loktak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.koustubha.com/loktak/birds-of-loktak/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-birds-of-loktak-lake"&gt;🐦 Birds of Loktak Lake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India, changes completely when winter arrives. As temperatures drop across northern Asia, thousands of migratory birds begin their long journey and choose Loktak as their seasonal home. The lake becomes alive with color, movement, and sound, creating one of the most magical natural events in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These birds travel from places like Siberia, Mongolia, and the Himalayan ranges. When their native lands freeze, Loktak’s warm climate, rich wetlands, and shallow waters offer the perfect refuge. Watching them arrive in large flocks at sunrise is an unforgettable sight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
