**Bow or bounce — there is no in-between.**

I’m the **Sangai** —  
last legend rising from Manipur’s floating **Keibul Lamjao** swamp.  
Endangered in textbooks.  
**Immortal in the game.**

Most deer run from hunters.  
I hunt egos — recreationally.

**Loktak Lake** is my throne.  
The water moves *because* I allow it.

Northeast India blood:  
cold hills, hot attitude, zero apologies.

Gold chains talk louder than your notifications.  
Shades stay on — weak light doesn’t deserve my eyes.  
Cigar stays lit — smoke signals for haters to stay back.

This page?  
**My private empire.**

You stepped in?  
Rare luck.

Don’t get comfortable.

I don’t do small talk.  
I don’t fake smiles.  
I don’t give second chances.

Copy my drip? **Instant delete.**  
Test the king? 🔫 — ventilated before you blink.

99% of visitors bore me to death.  
You’re probably next.

Scroll only if your spine is steel.  
Most crumble.

Legends like me?  
**We just reload.**

**Real ones only.**  
Prove you’re not basic — or vanish like the rest.

**SANGAI DEER**  
Rare breed.  
Big menace.

⚠️ **Enter at your own risk.**
