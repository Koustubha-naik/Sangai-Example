# 🦌 About the Sangai Deer

**Namaskar. Eina Sangai ni** — the rare and graceful *Dancing Deer* of Manipur.  
I live in a magical place called **Keibul Lamjao National Park**, the world’s only floating wildlife sanctuary.  
My steps are gentle because the  **phumdis** (floating islands) beneath me rise and fall like soft cushions.

People call me the *Dancing Deer* because my walk looks like a slow, careful dance.  
But behind this beauty is a fragile story — only a small number of us remain, protected with care and deep love by the people of Manipur.

## 🌿 My Home  
Loktak Lake is my world —  
its misty mornings, quiet waters, and drifting phumdis are woven into my life.  
The lake is not just a habitat; it is a living, breathing part of us.

## 🌱 A Species Worth Protecting  
The Sangai is more than an animal —  
**we are a symbol of hope, identity, and resilience**.  
Conservation efforts continue so we can thrive peacefully in our floating home.
