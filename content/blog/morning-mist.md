# 🌅 Morning Mist of Loktak

Every morning, just before the sun rises over Loktak Lake, the world becomes quiet and weightless.
A thin sheet of mist drifts across the water, softening every sound and turning the entire lake into a pale, glowing dream.
The fishermen move slowly through this silent world, their boats cutting smooth lines through the silver haze.

This moment — delicate, cold, and peaceful — is one of the most breathtaking scenes in the Sangai’s floating home.

## 🌫 Why the Mist Forms

The mist of Loktak appears when warm lake water meets the cool morning air.
The floating **phumdis** also release moisture during the night, intensifying the early fog.

Researchers record small climate patterns that show how mist density changes throughout the year.

Here is a simple ASCII graph representing **mist density vs. time of day**, based on sample environmental readings:

```
Mist Density (0–10)

10 |         *****       
 9 |        *******      
 8 |       *********     
 7 |      ***********    
 6 |     *************   
 5 |    ***************  
 4 |   ******     ****** 
 3 |  *****       *****  
 2 | ***           ***   
 1 | *               *   
 0 +----------------------
      4am   5am   6am   7am
```

The mist peaks around **5:15 AM**, just before light breaks over the lake.

## 🧪 A Little “Morning Mist Model” (Example Code)

```py
# Simple mist simulation for Loktak Lake
def mist_density(temp, humidity, wind):
    base = humidity * 0.6 - temp * 0.2
    wind_factor = max(0, 1 - wind * 0.1)
    return round(max(0, base * wind_factor), 2)

# Sample readings just before sunrise
readings = [
    ("4:00 AM", mist_density(17, 92, 2)),
    ("5:00 AM", mist_density(16, 95, 1)),
    ("6:00 AM", mist_density(18, 80, 3)),
    ("7:00 AM", mist_density(22, 60, 5)),
]

for time, density in readings:
    print(time, "-> Mist Level:", density)
```

## 🚣 The Fishermen in the Mist

Hidden in the early fog, fishermen from the surrounding villages row quietly across the lake.
Their silhouettes appear like shadows drifting through silver light.
You hear nothing except the faint splash of water and the soft crunch of bamboo poles brushing against phumdis.

---

## 🐦 Birds That Follow the Mist

As the mist begins to lift, migratory birds start calling across the lake.
Their wings slice through the rising sunbeams, leaving trails of gold on the water.

If you watch closely, you’ll see:

- **herons** stepping through shallow mist
- **kingfishers** diving with sharp flashes of blue
- **ducks** scattering soft ripples near the shore

## 🌞 Mist Meets Sunlight

By 7 AM, the mist slowly fades into warm sunlight.
The lake transforms from silver to deep blue.
The floating phumdis begin to show their shapes again, and life across Loktak wakes up fully.

## 💙 A Moment Worth Protecting

Moments like this remind us why Loktak Lake is irreplaceable.
The mist, the water, the floating islands, the wildlife, and the people all form one living system.

To protect the Sangai is to protect Loktak.
And to protect Loktak is to preserve mornings like these — quiet, magical, and full of life.
