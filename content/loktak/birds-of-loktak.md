# 🐦 Birds of Loktak Lake

Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India, changes completely when winter arrives. As temperatures drop across northern Asia, thousands of migratory birds begin their long journey and choose Loktak as their seasonal home. The lake becomes alive with color, movement, and sound, creating one of the most magical natural events in the region.

These birds travel from places like Siberia, Mongolia, and the Himalayan ranges. When their native lands freeze, Loktak’s warm climate, rich wetlands, and shallow waters offer the perfect refuge. Watching them arrive in large flocks at sunrise is an unforgettable sight.

Among the most common winter visitors are the **Ruddy Shelduck**, **Northern Pintail**, **Common Teal**, **Eurasian Wigeon**, and **Pheasant-tailed Jacana**. You can also find graceful waders like the **Grey Heron**, **Little Egret**, and **Cormorants** silently hunting along the edges of the lake.

One of the most unique features of Loktak Lake is the presence of *phumdis*—floating masses of vegetation. These natural platforms act as resting and feeding spots for many species. Birds hop between these floating islands, searching for insects, fish, and aquatic plants.

The lake is closely connected to **Keibul Lamjao National Park**, the world’s only floating national park. While it is famous for the endangered Sangai deer, the park also serves as a protected zone that indirectly supports visiting birds by keeping parts of the ecosystem untouched.

For birdwatchers and photographers, winter at Loktak is pure joy. Early mornings are especially beautiful, with golden sunlight reflecting on the water and flocks sweeping across the sky. Even casual visitors cannot miss the charm and peaceful rhythm created by these seasonal guests.

However, Loktak Lake also faces real challenges. Pollution, plastic waste, encroachment, and disturbances caused by human activity threaten the birds’ habitat. Some migratory species have already shown a decline in recent years.

Conservation efforts are growing. Local communities, nature groups, and government bodies work together to protect the lake. Cleaning drives, awareness programs, and responsible tourism practices all play a role in keeping Loktak healthy.

The arrival of migratory birds at Loktak is not just a natural event—it is a reminder of how connected the world is. Birds cross countries and continents, yet return to this lake year after year because it offers safety and nourishment.

Experiencing Loktak during winter teaches us to cherish nature’s delicate balance. These birds bring beauty, life, and a sense of wonder that makes the lake truly special.

Their journey and presence inspire us to protect this paradise for many more winters to come.
