# 🦌 Most Important Things in Keibul Lamjao National Park

Keibul Lamjao National Park is the **world’s only floating national park**, located on the southern edge of Loktak Lake in Manipur.  
Its landscape, wildlife, and ecosystem are unlike anywhere else in the world.  
Here are the **most important features** that define this extraordinary place.

---

## 🥇 1. The Sangai Deer — The Heart of the Park

The **Sangai** (*Rucervus eldii eldii*) is the most important species in the park and the primary reason this area is protected.

- Endemic to Manipur  
- Known as the *Dancing Deer*  
- Walks gracefully on floating phumdis  
- Critically endangered  
- Considered a cultural symbol of the Meitei people  

Without the Sangai, Keibul Lamjao would lose its identity.

## 🥈 2. The Floating Phumdis — The Foundation of Life

**Phumdis** are thick, floating mats made of vegetation, roots, soil, and organic matter.

- Act as “floating land”  
- Move up and down with water levels  
- Provide habitat for animals  
- Essential for Sangai movement  
- Unique to Loktak Lake  

The survival of the park depends on the health of these phumdis.

## 🥉 3. Loktak Lake Ecosystem — The Life Source

The entire park *floats* on the waters of **Loktak Lake**, the largest freshwater lake in Manipur.

- Provides water, food, and habitat  
- Creates perfect wetland conditions  
- Supports fish, birds, plants, and mammals  
- Deeply linked to local culture  

Loktak and Keibul Lamjao are inseparable ecological partners.

- Water lilies
